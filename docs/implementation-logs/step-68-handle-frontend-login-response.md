# Step 68: Handle Frontend Login Response

## Overview

This step involves implementing JavaScript logic to check the API response from the login request. On success (status 200), we need to extract the JWT. On failure (status 401), we need to display an appropriate error message on the login page.

## Implementation Details

The functionality for this step was already implemented as part of Step 66 in the `public/js/login.js` file. The code that handles the API response is as follows:

```javascript
const data = await response.json();

if (response.ok && data.success) {
    // Login successful - store token in sessionStorage
    sessionStorage.setItem('guestToken', data.token);
    sessionStorage.setItem('guestName', data.guest.name);
    sessionStorage.setItem('guestRoomNumber', data.guest.roomNumber);
    
    // Redirect to home page
    window.location.href = '/home.html';
} else {
    // Login failed - show error message
    errorMessage.textContent = data.error || 'Login failed. Please check your room number and last name, or contact the front desk.';
    errorMessage.style.display = 'block';
    
    // Enable form again
    submitButton.disabled = false;
    submitButton.textContent = 'Login';
}
```

This code successfully:
1. Parses the JSON response from the API
2. Checks if the response was successful (`response.ok && data.success`)
3. On success:
   - Extracts the JWT token and stores it in `sessionStorage`
   - Also stores additional guest information
4. On failure:
   - Displays the error message returned by the API
   - Falls back to a generic error message if the API doesn't provide one
   - Re-enables the login button for the user to try again

## Error Handling

The implementation also includes a try-catch block to handle any unexpected errors that might occur during the API call or response processing:

```javascript
catch (error) {
    console.error('Login error:', error);
    errorMessage.textContent = 'An error occurred. Please try again later or contact the front desk.';
    errorMessage.style.display = 'block';
    
    // Enable form again
    const submitButton = loginForm.querySelector('button[type="submit"]');
    submitButton.disabled = false;
    submitButton.textContent = 'Login';
}
```

This ensures that even if there are network issues or other unexpected errors, the user receives appropriate feedback and can retry their login.

## Testing

The response handling functionality was tested as part of Step 66:
- Verified that successful logins lead to the JWT being stored correctly in `sessionStorage`
- Confirmed that error messages from the API are displayed properly
- Tested the fallback error message when the API doesn't return a specific error
- Verified that the form is re-enabled after a failed login attempt
- Tested error handling for network issues

## Next Steps

The next steps in the implementation plan are Steps 69 and 70, which involve storing the JWT and redirecting after login. These functionalities were also already implemented as part of Step 66, as they are integral parts of handling the login response.
