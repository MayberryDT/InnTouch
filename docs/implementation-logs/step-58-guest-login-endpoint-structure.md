# Step 58: Guest Login Endpoint Structure

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S)

**Changes Made:**
- Added a new `POST /auth/guest/login` route to `src/server/routes/auth.js`.
- The route accepts `roomNumber` and `lastName` from the request body.
- Includes basic input validation to check for the presence of these fields.
- Logs the received credentials to the console.
- Returns a placeholder success JSON response.
- **NOTE:** Actual authentication logic (database query, JWT generation) is *not* implemented in this step and will follow in Steps 59-61.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/server/routes/auth.js`
- `docs/implementation-plan.md` (Marked step as complete)

**Next Steps:**
- Implement Step 59: Backend logic to query the `guests` table.
