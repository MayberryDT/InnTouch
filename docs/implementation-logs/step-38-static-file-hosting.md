# Step 38: Static File Hosting

**Date:** March 26, 2025  
**Step:** 38 - Set up static file hosting: Configure the server to serve frontend files from a dedicated directory.

## Overview

In this step, I configured the server to serve static files from the dedicated `public` directory. This is a crucial foundational step for the frontend development, enabling the serving of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to users' browsers.

## Implementation Details

1. **Examined the Current Configuration:**
   - Found that the Express app was already configured to serve static files from the 'public' directory in `app.js`:
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
   ```

2. **Enhanced the Static Files Structure:**
   - Created a `css` directory within the public folder for organizing stylesheets
   - Developed a main `style.css` file with CSS variables and styles based on the frontend guidelines
   - Created a test page and JavaScript file to verify functionality
   - Updated the existing index.html to use the external stylesheet

3. **Directory Structure Created:**
   ```
   public/
   ├── index.html        - Main entry page
   ├── test.html         - Test page to verify static hosting
   ├── css/
   │   └── style.css     - Main stylesheet with design system
   └── js/
       ├── chat.js       - Existing chat functionality 
       └── test.js       - Test script to verify JS serving
   ```

## Testing Results

I verified that the static file hosting works correctly:

1. **Server Status Check:**
   - Confirmed the server is running by accessing the API status endpoint:
   ```
   curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/status
   ```
   - Response: `{"status":"online","message":"Inn Touch API is running","version":"1.0.0"}`

2. **Static HTML Serving:**
   - Confirmed HTML files are served correctly:
   ```
   curl -s http://localhost:3000/test.html
   ```
   - Successfully received the complete HTML content

3. **CSS Serving:**
   - Confirmed CSS files are served correctly:
   ```
   curl -s http://localhost:3000/css/style.css
   ```
   - Successfully received the complete CSS content

4. **JavaScript Serving:**
   - Confirmed JavaScript files are served correctly:
   ```
   curl -s http://localhost:3000/js/test.js
   ```
   - Successfully received the complete JavaScript content

## Conclusion

The static file hosting is now properly configured and tested. The Express server successfully serves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the 'public' directory. This setup provides the foundation for implementing the frontend components of the Inn Touch application.

The CSS has been organized according to the frontend guidelines, using the specified color palette, typography, and spacing. The JavaScript functionality was verified to ensure it can be loaded and executed properly.

## Next Steps

- Implement the core HTML pages for each feature (Home, Chat, Room Service, etc.)
- Add a consistent navigation menu across all pages
