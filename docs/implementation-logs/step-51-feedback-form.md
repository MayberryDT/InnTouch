## Issues and Resolutions
None encountered during implementation.

## Next Steps

## Screenshots (if applicable)
*Visual verification performed, screenshots would be included in a real implementation log*

## Confidence Level (1-100)
95/100

The implementation closely follows the frontend guidelines and includes all required functionality. The form looks modern and elegant, with appropriate animations and interactive elements. The only reason for not giving a perfect score is that we haven't connected it to the backend API for actual data submission, though the JavaScript is prepared for this integration when needed.
