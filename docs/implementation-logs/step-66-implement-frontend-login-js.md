# Step 66: Implement Frontend Login Js

## Changes Made

- Created a new file `public/js/login.js` to handle the login form submission:
  - Added event listener for form submission
  - Implemented form validation
  - Added fetch API call to send login request to backend
  - Added error handling and success redirection
  - Implemented button state updates during form submission
  
- Updated `public/login.html` to include the login.js script:
  - Added script tag to load the JavaScript file

## Technical Details

- The script uses event delegation to handle the form submission event
- It validates that both room number and last name are provided
- On successful login:
  - Stores the JWT token in sessionStorage
  - Stores basic guest information in sessionStorage
  - Redirects to the home page
- On failed login:
  - Displays appropriate error message
  - Re-enables the login button
- Added error handling for network errors or other exceptions

## Testing

- Confirmed the script runs when the page loads
- Tested form validation by submitting empty fields
- Tested the error message display for invalid credentials
- Verified authentication flow works with the test guest (room 999, name "Test")

## Next Steps

The next step is Step 67, but this is already incorporated in the current implementation since we've added the Fetch API call to `/auth/guest/login` as part of this step. Similarly, steps 68, 69, and 70 (handling the response, storing the JWT, and redirecting after login) have also been implemented in this step since they are naturally part of the login form submission handler.
