# Step 49: Property Info Page

## Date
March 27, 2025

## Task
Develop property info page with static content about the hotel, including policies and contact details.

## Implementation Details

Created a new static HTML page (`property-info.html`) containing property information organized into four main collapsible sections:

1. **Property Amenities**
   - Comprehensive list of hotel amenities with descriptions
   - Visually enhanced with icon bullet points

2. **Policies & Guidelines**
   - Key hotel policies including smoking, pets, cancellations, etc.
   - Clearly formatted for easy reading

3. **Hours & Timings**
   - Check-in/check-out information
   - Facility hours in a structured table format

4. **Contact Information**
   - Contact details organized in a responsive grid layout
   - Phone numbers, email addresses, and physical address

## Technical Implementation

- Created collapsible sections using vanilla JavaScript for interactive experience
- Added smooth animations and hover effects for modern UI feel
- Used Font Awesome icons to enhance visual presentation
- Implemented responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile
- Followed the project's styling guidelines (fonts, colors, spacing)
- The first section expands by default when the page loads

## Code Sample

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Add click event to all section headers
    const sectionHeaders = document.querySelectorAll('.section-header');
    
    sectionHeaders.forEach(header => {
        header.addEventListener('click', function() {
            // Toggle active class on header
            this.classList.toggle('active');
            
            // Toggle content visibility
            const content = this.nextElementSibling;
            if (content.classList.contains('active')) {
                content.classList.remove('active');
                content.style.display = 'none';
            } else {
                content.classList.add('active');
                content.style.display = 'block';
            }
        });
        
        // Open the first section by default
        if (header === sectionHeaders[0]) {
            header.click();
        }
    });
});
```

## Testing

- Verified the page loads correctly with a 200 HTTP status
- Tested all collapsible sections expand and collapse as expected
- Confirmed responsive layout works on different screen sizes
- Validated that styling matches the design guidelines

## Notes

The property info page is now complete with all required static content and interactive elements. This implementation follows the project requirements for a clean, readable layout with collapsible sections. No database interaction was needed as this is purely static content.

## Next Steps

- Step 50: Implement the local map page with interactive markers
