# Step 65: Guest Login Html

## Implementation Details

I created a guest login page (`public/login.html`) with the following components:

1. **Room Number Input Field**: Allows guests to enter their room number
2. **Last Name Input Field**: Allows guests to enter their last name
3. **Login Button**: Submits the guest credentials
4. **Error Message Area**: Area to display login errors (initially hidden)

The form was styled according to the frontend guidelines, using:
- The Inter font for regular text and Playfair Display for headings
- Primary blue and white color scheme
- Responsive design that works on both mobile and desktop devices
- Subtle animations for hover effects on the button and error message display

## Code Structure

- Created the HTML structure with proper input fields and form elements
- Added CSS styling inline to ensure consistent appearance 
- Set up appropriate input types and validation attributes
- Created an error message area that will be toggled with JavaScript in Step 66
- Ensured accessibility with proper labels and focus states

## Testing

The login page displays correctly and follows the design guidelines. The form fields accept input, and the login button has appropriate hover/active states. The error message area is initially hidden as expected.

All layout and styling is functioning properly on different viewport sizes:
- Desktop: Form is centered with appropriate width
- Mobile: Form adjusts to fit smaller screens

## Next Steps

The HTML structure and styling for the guest login page is now complete. In Step 66, we'll implement the required JavaScript functionality to handle form submission, which will include:
1. Capturing form submission events
2. Validating user input
3. Preparing to make API calls to authenticate the guest

## Confidence Score: 95/100

I'm highly confident in the implementation because:
- The login page follows the existing application patterns and design language
- All necessary form fields are present with proper attributes
- The error message area is properly set up for later JavaScript use
- The styling is consistent with the frontend guidelines
- The page is responsive for different device sizes

The 5 point reduction is due to:
- The hardcoded error message may need adjustment depending on actual backend responses
- There's no form validation other than the required attribute, which should be enhanced in Step 66
