# Step 47: Booking Interface

## Date: March 27, 2023

## Task Description
Design a booking interface form that shows available services and time slots for booking.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created a JavaScript file for booking functionality
Created `public/js/booking.js` to handle the booking form interactions:
- Added date picker for selecting booking dates
- Added functionality to fetch available time slots from the backend API
- Implemented dynamic updating of available time slots based on date selection
- Added form submission handling to send booking data to the backend

### 2. Updated booking.html
- Added CSS for date pickers and available time slots display
- Removed inline JavaScript and replaced it with a reference to the external booking.js file
- Improved styling for time slots, making them more responsive with flex-wrap

### 3. Added a new API endpoint
Added a new endpoint to `src/server/routes/guest.js` to fetch available time slots:
- `GET /api/availability` - Retrieves available time slots for a specific service on a given date
- The endpoint validates the input parameters (type, name, date) and returns a list of available time slots
- Connected to the existing database functions for checking availability

## Testing

The implementation has been tested by:
- Starting the server to verify there are no syntax errors
- Manual testing in the browser to verify the functionality works as expected
- Verified that the date picker appears correctly
- Confirmed that the booking form is displayed when a time slot is selected

## Issues and Resolutions

No major issues were encountered during implementation.

## Next Steps

- Step 48: Handle booking feedback - Implement proper success and error message display
- Add more robust error handling
- Implement better validation for the booking form

## Confidence Score: 85/100

I am fairly confident in this implementation because:
1. The code follows the existing patterns in the application
2. The UI components integrate well with the existing styling
3. The API endpoints are properly connected to the database functions

However, there are a few areas that could be improved:
1. Better error handling for network failures
2. More thorough testing with different devices and screen sizes
3. The guest ID is currently hardcoded (1) for testing, which would need to be replaced with actual guest authentication in production
