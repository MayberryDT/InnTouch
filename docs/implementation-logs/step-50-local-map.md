# Step 50: Local Map

## Date
March 27, 2023

## Summary
Successfully implemented the Local Map feature that displays an interactive map with markers for nearby points of interest. The map allows guests to explore recommended places around the hotel, filter by category, and view details about each location.

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components
- Created `partners.js` database module that provides functions for fetching partner/POI data
- Added partners module to database index for easy access
- Implemented a `/api/partners` API endpoint in the guest routes to serve partner data
- Set up static data for demonstrations, with the architecture allowing for database-driven data in the future

### Frontend Components
- Created a dedicated `local-map.js` file that handles:
  - Fetching data from the API
  - Initializing the Leaflet map
  - Adding markers for the hotel and nearby locations
  - Creating a list of locations below the map
  - Handling category filtering (restaurants, shopping, attractions)
  - Handling error scenarios with fallback to static data
- Updated `local-map.html` to use the separate JavaScript file
- Added error handling for failed API requests with a graceful fallback

## Features Implemented
- Interactive map using Leaflet with OpenStreetMap
- Hotel marker in the center with the user's current location
- Markers for nearby recommended places
- Popup information when clicking markers
- Category filtering via checkboxes
- List of recommended places with details
- Clicking on a list item focuses the map on that location
- Mobile-responsive design for both map and location list

## Testing
- Verified map initialization with the hotel at the center
- Confirmed that all markers appear correctly with appropriate icons
- Tested category filtering to show/hide markers and list items
- Checked location list rendering and clicking behavior
- Validated the error handling with the fallback system
- Tested responsive behavior on different screen sizes

## Confidence Score: 95/100

The implementation fully meets the requirements outlined in the specification. The Leaflet map is properly integrated, markers work as expected, and the filtering functionality enhances usability. The architecture is clean with separation of concerns between data access and presentation.

The 5-point deduction is due to the current use of static data instead of a full database implementation, though this is acceptable per the project requirements which state "Uses Leaflet with static or SQLite-stored partner data." The system is designed to easily transition to database storage in the future if needed.

## Next Steps
- Move on to Step 51: Create feedback form
- Consider enhancements for future iterations:
  - Directions functionality
  - Search capability within the map
  - User location detection for distance calculation
  - More dynamic filtering options
