# Step 70: Redirect After Login

## Overview

This step involves redirecting the user from the login page to the Home Page after successfully storing the JWT token in sessionStorage.

## Implementation Details

The functionality for this step required fixing multiple issues in the implementation:

1. Updated the `public/js/login.js` file to properly handle form submission:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const loginForm = document.getElementById('login-form');
    const errorMessage = document.getElementById('login-error');
    
    if (!loginForm) {
        console.error('Login form not found');
        return;
    }
    
    // The critical line - preventing form submission
    loginForm.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
        e.preventDefault(); // This stops the form from submitting normally
        handleLogin();
    });
    
    async function handleLogin() {
        // ... validation and API call code ...
        
        if (response.ok && data.success) {
            // Login successful - store token in sessionStorage
            sessionStorage.setItem('guestToken', data.token);
            sessionStorage.setItem('guestName', data.guest.name);
            sessionStorage.setItem('guestRoomNumber', data.guest.roomNumber);
            
            console.log('Login successful, redirecting to home page...');
            
            // Redirect to home page
            window.location.href = '/index.html';
        }
    }
});
```

2. Updated `public/login.html` to add additional safeguards against traditional form submission:

```html
<form id="login-form" class="login-form" method="POST" onsubmit="return false">
    <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

3. Fixed the redirect URL to point to the correct page:
   - Changed `window.location.href = '/home.html';` to `window.location.href = '/index.html';`

The key changes made were:
1. Restructuring the code to use a separate `handleLogin()` function for better organization
2. Multiple layers of form submission prevention:
   - JavaScript `e.preventDefault()` in the event listener
   - HTML `onsubmit="return false"` attribute as a backup
   - Setting `method="POST"` to prevent query parameters in the URL
3. Correcting the redirect URL to the existing index.html file
4. Adding console.log statements for debugging

## User Experience Considerations

The immediate redirect after successful login is a good user experience pattern:
- It's intuitive for users to be taken directly to the main application after login
- There's no unnecessary delay or intermediate steps
- The flow is consistent with standard web application behavior

## Testing

The redirect functionality was tested:
- Verified that form submission is properly prevented (the page doesn't refresh or append query parameters)
- Confirmed that after successful login and JWT storage, the user is immediately redirected to `/index.html`
- Tested that the authentication state is preserved across the redirect
- Added logging to verify the login success and redirect path

## Next Steps

The next steps in the implementation plan are Steps 71 and 72, which involve:
1. Implementing a logout functionality that removes the JWT from sessionStorage and redirects back to the login page
2. Adding route protection to ensure that unauthenticated users cannot access protected pages
