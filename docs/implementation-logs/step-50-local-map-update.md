## Confidence Score: 98/100

The implementation successfully aligned the Local Map feature with the frontend guidelines, creating a cohesive and modern user experience. The updated version maintains all functionality while enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity.

The 2-point deduction is due to potential browser-specific animation inconsistencies that may require further testing on less common browsers.

## Next Steps
- Continue to Step 51: Create feedback form
