## Adjusting CSP for Unsplash Images (4/7/2025, 10:19:45 PM)

_**User**_

These console errors are from @room-service.html and they are blocking images from unsplash links. Please change the CSP to allow these images:

Okay, I understand. The Content Security Policy (CSP) is preventing images from `images.unsplash.com` from loading on the `room-service.html` page. I need to update the server's CSP configuration to allow this domain.

First, I'll search for where the `Content-Security-Policy` header is being set in your backend code.

Okay, the initial searches didn't pinpoint the exact location of the CSP header definition in the active source code. It seems it might be set dynamically or through a middleware configuration.

I'll try searching again, this time looking more broadly for `Content-Security-Policy` within the `src` directory to find where it's being configured.

It seems the CSP header is not explicitly set in the JavaScript files within the `src` directory. It might be configured in a different way, perhaps through a middleware library or directly in the main server file.

Let's broaden the search to the entire project, excluding `.specstory` history files, to see if it's defined elsewhere.

Okay, that's unexpected. The `Content-Security-Policy` header isn't explicitly defined anywhere in the codebase (outside of history files).

It's possible it's being set by a dependency or a default configuration in Express or another middleware. Since I can't find the explicit setting, I'll try adding a middleware specifically for the `/room-service.html` route to modify the `img-src` directive.

Where is the main Express app setup located? I'll need to add the middleware there. I'll search for `express()` to find the main application file.

Okay, I've found the Content Security Policy configuration in `app.js`. It's being set using the `helmet` middleware.

I will now edit the `img-src` directive within the `helmet` configuration in `app.js` to allow images from `https://images.unsplash.com`.

I have updated the Content Security Policy in `app.js` to include `https://images.unsplash.com` in the `img-src` directive.

Please restart your development server and reload the `room-service.html` page. The images from Unsplash should now load correctly. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!

Okay, it looks like the `local-map.html` page is trying to fetch data from an endpoint `/api/partners` which doesn't exist on the server, resulting in a 404 error.

Based on the structure in `app.js`, guest-related API endpoints seem to be prefixed with `/guest`. Let's check the `local-map.js` file to see the exact fetch call and then adjust it to use the likely correct path, `/guest/api/partners`.

First, I'll read the relevant part of `local-map.js`.

Okay, the URL is correct now, but the server is responding with a 401 Unauthorized error. The server logs confirm this, stating "Guest authentication failed: No auth token".

This means the `/guest/api/partners` endpoint requires authentication, but the `fetch` request in `local-map.js` isn't sending the necessary credentials (likely a JWT stored in session storage).

The `auth.js` script should handle retrieving the token. I need to examine `auth.js` to see how it makes the token available, and then update the `fetchPartners` function in `local-map.js` to include the token in the request headers.

First, I'll read the contents of `public/js/auth.js`.

---

---

Okay, `auth.js` confirms that the guest authentication token is stored in `sessionStorage` under the key `guestToken`.

I will now modify the `fetchPartners` function in `public/js/local-map.js` to retrieve this token and include it in the `Authorization` header of the fetch request to `/guest/api/partners`.

      async function fetchPartners() {

I've updated `public/js/local-map.js` to include the authentication token in the request header. It also now checks for a 401 response and redirects to the login page if authentication fails.

Please refresh the `local-map.html` page again. Assuming you are logged in and have a valid token, the map data should now load successfully. Let me know the result!

Okay, the authentication is working now, but we're back to a 404 Not Found error for `/guest/api/partners`.

Looking at the server logs you provided:
```
Successfully authenticated guest user: guestId 7
Guest authentication successful via Passport middleware for guestId: 7
[ERROR] Not Found - /guest/api/partners
```
This confirms the server authenticates the request successfully but then cannot find a handler for the `/guest/api/partners` path.

It seems this specific route might not be defined in the backend. I need to check the guest route definitions. I'll read the `src/server/routes/guest.js` file where guest-specific routes are likely defined.

---

_****_

You are correct, the `/guest/api/partners` route is not defined in `src/server/routes/guest.js`, which explains the 404 error even after successful authentication.

I need to find where the logic for fetching partner data resides and then add the corresponding route handler. I'll start by looking for files related to "partners" in the database and server directories.

Okay, there's a `src/database/partners.js` file. This likely contains the function to fetch partner data.

I will now read this file to understand its functionality and how to use it in the route handler.

---

---

_****_

Okay, `src/database/partners.js` exports two functions: `getAllPartners` and `getHotelLocation`. It currently returns static data, which is fine for now.

I will now add a new route handler for `GET /guest/api/partners` in `src/server/routes/guest.js`. This handler will use the `authenticateGuest` middleware, call `getAllPartners` and `getHotelLocation`, and return the combined data.

---

It seems the edit wasn't applied correctly. I'll try reapplying the changes to add the `/guest/api/partners` route handler in `src/server/routes/guest.js`.

Okay, the `/guest/api/partners` route handler has now been added to `src/server/routes/guest.js`.

Please restart your development server and refresh the `local-map.html` page. The map should now load the partner data without errors. Let me know if everything works as expected!

Okay, let's break down these errors from the staff dashboard.

1.  **Server Health Check (404 Not Found):** The dashboard tries to check if the server is running by sending a request to `/api/health`, but this endpoint doesn't exist on your server (`app.js`), causing the 404 error. This incorrectly makes the dashboard think the server is down and use fallback data for some components.
2.  **Escalated Chats Timeout:** The request to `/api/chat/escalated` is timing out after 5 seconds. The server logs show this route was hit and attempted to call the database function `getEscalatedChats`. The timeout might be happening during the database query itself or within the route handler logic.
3.  **Cloudbeds Sync (503 Service Unavailable):** The attempt to import data from Cloudbeds fails because the server couldn't connect properly to the Cloudbeds API. The server logs you provided earlier show the specific reason:
    ```
    API ERROR [Cloudbeds API] [NETWORK_ERROR]: invalid json response body at https://hotels.cloudbeds.com/api/v1.1/guests?status=checked_in reason: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
    ```
    This means the Cloudbeds API returned HTML (likely an error or login page) instead of the expected JSON data. This could be due to:
    *   An invalid or expired Cloudbeds API key in your `.env` file.
    *   An incorrect Cloudbeds API endpoint URL being used.
    *   A temporary issue with the Cloudbeds service itself.
    *   Network configuration preventing the server from reaching Cloudbeds.

**Here's the plan:**

1.  **Add the `/api/health` endpoint:** I'll add a simple health check route to `app.js` so the dashboard can correctly detect if the server is running.
2.  **Investigate the chat timeout:** I'll examine the route handler for `/api/chat/escalated` to see if there's an obvious cause for the timeout.
3.  **Address Cloudbeds:** Since the Cloudbeds issue is likely configuration or external, I'll advise you on how to check those potential problems after fixing the other two issues.

Let's start by adding the health check endpoint.

---

_****_

```diff
    });
  });
+ 
+ // --- Add Health Check Route --- 
+ app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
+   res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok', message: 'Server is running' });
+ });
+ // --- End Health Check Route ---
  
  // API Routes
```

---

_****_

Now, let's look at the chat route. I need to find where `/api/chat/escalated` is defined. It's likely in `src/server/routes/chat.js` or `src/server/routes/staff.js`. I'll search for it.

The search confirms the route is defined in `src/server/routes/chat.js`. Let's examine that file.

The route handler for `/api/chat/escalated` in `src/server/routes/chat.js` looks straightforward. It calls `chatDb.getEscalatedChats()` to fetch the data. The server logs show the call is made, but the client times out before a response or error is logged from the server after that point. This strongly suggests the database query within `getEscalatedChats` is the source of the timeout.

I need to examine the `getEscalatedChats` function in `src/database/chat.js`.

Okay, I've examined the `getEscalatedChats` function in `src/database/chat.js`. The SQL query used to fetch the chats includes a subquery to get the last message for each guest:

```sql
SELECT c.guest_id, g.name as guest_name, g.room_number,
       MAX(c.timestamp) as last_message_time,
       (SELECT message FROM chat_logs
        WHERE guest_id = c.guest_id
        ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1) as last_message
FROM chat_logs c
JOIN guests g ON c.guest_id = g.id
WHERE c.sender_type = 'guest'
GROUP BY c.guest_id
ORDER BY last_message_time DESC
```

This type of correlated subquery can sometimes be inefficient on large tables, potentially leading to the timeout you're seeing. Adding database indexes might significantly improve the query's performance.

I'll add indexes to the `chat_logs` table on the `guest_id`, `sender_type`, and `timestamp` columns. This requires modifying the database schema definition. I'll look for the schema file, likely `src/database/schema.js`.

+ CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chat_logs_timestamp ON chat_logs (timestamp);
  `;
  
```

It seems the edit only added two of the three indexes. I'll try reapplying to ensure all three indexes (`idx_chat_logs_guest_id`, `idx_chat_logs_sender_type`, `idx_chat_logs_timestamp`) are added to `src/database/schema.js`.

---

_****_



---

It seems the reapply overwrote the file with an older version and didn't include the indexes I intended. This is not correct.

Let me try the edit again carefully, ensuring the three `CREATE INDEX` statements for `chat_logs` are added to the existing `createIndexes` string, not replacing the file content.

---

_****_

```diff
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chat_status_guest_id ON chat_status (guest_id);
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chat_status_status ON chat_status (status);
+ CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chat_logs_sender_type ON chat_logs (sender_type);
+ CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chat_logs_timestamp ON chat_logs (timestamp);
  `;
  
```

Okay, the indexes for `chat_logs` should now be correctly defined in `src/database/schema.js`.

**Important:** These schema changes (adding the health check endpoint and the database indexes) require you to **stop and restart your Node.js server**. The database setup script (`src/database/db.js` or similar) should apply the new schema, including the indexes, when the server starts.

After restarting the server, please check the staff dashboard again.

1.  The server health check should now pass.
2.  The escalated chats should load much faster without timing out.
3.  The Cloudbeds sync error (503) will likely persist. As mentioned, this is probably due to an invalid API key in your `.env` file or an external issue with Cloudbeds. Please check your `CLOUDBEDS_API_KEY` in the `.env` file and ensure it's correct. If it is, you may need to investigate further or contact Cloudbeds support.

Let me know the results after restarting the server!

Okay, the logs show progress!

*   The `HEAD /api/health` check is now working (200 OK), so the dashboard correctly detects the server is running.
*   However, the `/api/chat/escalated` request is still timing out on the client-side after 5 seconds.
*   The server logs confirm the request is received, authenticated, and the database query is executed (`[DEBUG-DB] Executing query: ...`). But the query seems to be taking too long, as no further logs appear from the server for that request before the client gives up.

It seems the database indexes we added weren't sufficient to speed up the `getEscalatedChats` query enough. The correlated subquery used to fetch the last message is likely the bottleneck.

Let's try optimizing the SQL query in `src/database/chat.js` by removing the correlated subquery. I'll rewrite it to first find the latest message ID for each guest and then join to get the details.
