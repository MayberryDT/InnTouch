_**User**_

On @booking.html I tried to do a test booking and it gave me a message 

'Booking Error
You are not authorized to make this booking. Please check in at the front desk.'

Here are the logs, please fix the problem so i can do a test booking:
navigation.js:80 Updating URL to include guestId: /booking.html?guestId=7

Okay, I see the problem. The logs show two key things:

1.  The guest ID being sent in the booking request (`guest_id: '1'`) doesn't match the one in the URL (`guestId=7`).
2.  The server is responding with a 401 Unauthorized error because the request is missing the authentication token (`{error: 'No auth token', statusCode: 401}`).

Let's fix these issues in `public/js/booking.js`.

I will first read the relevant parts of `public/js/booking.js` to confirm how the `guestId` is retrieved and how the API call is made.

Okay, I've reviewed the `public/js/booking.js` file and found the issues.

1.  The `getGuestId` function is hardcoding the guest ID to `'1'` instead of reading it from the URL.
2.  The `submitBooking` function doesn't retrieve the authentication token from local storage or include it in the API request headers.

I'll modify `public/js/booking.js` to correct these two problems.

```diff
          
          console.log('Submitting booking with data:', bookingData);
+         
+         // Retrieve auth token
+         const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
          
          // Submit to the API
          fetch('/api/guest/booking', {
              method: 'POST',
              headers: {
-                 'Content-Type': 'application/json'
+                 'Content-Type': 'application/json',
+                 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` // Add Authorization header
              },
              body: JSON.stringify(bookingData)
       */
      function getGuestId() {
-         // For now, we'll use a placeholder guest ID
-         // In a real app, this would be extracted from the URL/path or session
-         return '1';
+         // Extract guest ID from URL query parameters
+         const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
+         const guestId = urlParams.get('guestId');
+         
+         // Return the found guest ID or null if not found
+         return guestId;
      }
  }); 
```

---

_****_



---

_****_

I've updated the `public/js/booking.js` file:

1.  The `getGuestId` function now correctly extracts the `guestId` from the URL query parameters.
2.  The `submitBooking` function now retrieves the `authToken` from local storage and includes it in the `Authorization` header of the API request.

This should fix the unauthorized error and allow you to complete a test booking. Please try making the booking again.

Same thing is happening:

Okay, the error message `jwt malformed` means the server received the `Authorization` header, but the token itself is invalid or corrupted.

This could happen if the token stored in `localStorage` is incorrect, missing, or `null`. Let's add a quick check in `public/js/booking.js` to log the token just before sending the request. This will help us see what's actually being sent.

---

_****_

```diff
          // Retrieve auth token
          const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
+         console.log('Retrieved token:', token);
          
          // Submit to the API
```

---

_****_



---

_****_

I've added a `console.log` statement in `public/js/booking.js` to show the value of the `authToken` retrieved from `localStorage` right before it's sent to the server.

Please try the booking process again and check your browser's developer console. Look for the line that says "Retrieved token:". Let me know what value is logged there (it might be `null` or some unexpected string). This will tell us if the token is missing or corrupted in `localStorage`.

Okay, the log `Retrieved token: iukkw88jklr` shows that we *are* retrieving a token, but `"iukkw88jklr"` doesn't look like a standard JSON Web Token (JWT). JWTs usually have three parts separated by dots (e.g., `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`). The `jwt malformed` error from the server confirms that the token format is incorrect.

I've checked the `public/js/auth.js` script, which handles the initial login and token validation. It appears that the authentication token is stored in `sessionStorage` under the key `guestToken`, not in `localStorage` under `authToken`.

Let's correct `public/js/booking.js` to look for the token in the right place (`sessionStorage`) with the correct key (`guestToken`).

---

```diff
          console.log('Submitting booking with data:', bookingData);
          
-         // Retrieve auth token
-         const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
+         // Retrieve auth token from sessionStorage
+         const token = sessionStorage.getItem('guestToken');
          console.log('Retrieved token:', token);
          
```

---

_****_

I've updated `public/js/booking.js` to retrieve the token from `sessionStorage` using the key `guestToken`.

This should now send the correct token to the server. Please try the booking again.

Does this error mean that the name/email aren't matching when I submit a booking?

_****_

You're close! The error `403 Forbidden` with the message `You can only create bookings for yourself` doesn't mean the name/email are wrong, but rather that there's a mismatch between the guest ID you're *trying* to book for and the guest ID associated with your login session (the JWT token).

Here's what's happening:

1.  **Authentication Works:** The server successfully validated your JWT token (the long `eyJ...` string). It knows *who* is logged in.
2.  **Authorization Fails:** Your code is sending `guest_id: '7'` in the request body (taken from the URL parameter). The server checks the `guestId` embedded *inside* the validated token, finds it's different from `7`, and rejects the request because you're trying to book for a different guest than the one logged in.

**Solution:**

The backend should rely solely on the `guestId` from the validated JWT token to determine *who* is making the booking. We don't need to send `guest_id` in the request body from the client-side anymore.

I'll remove the `guest_id` field from the `bookingData` object in `public/js/booking.js`.

---

```diff
          }
          
-         // Create booking data object
+         // Create booking data object - Remove guest_id, server uses token
          const bookingData = {
-             guest_id: guestId,
+             // guest_id: guestId, // Removed: Let server determine guest from token
              type: selectedType,
              service: selectedService,
```

---

---

_****_

I've removed the `guest_id` field from the `bookingData` object sent in the request body within `public/js/booking.js`. The backend will now rely on the `guestId` extracted from the validated JWT token to associate the booking with the correct guest.

This should resolve the `403 Forbidden` error. Please try making the booking one more time.

Okay, this is unexpected. We've confirmed the client-side (`booking.js`) is now:

1.  Sending the correct JWT token (`guestToken` from `sessionStorage`) in the `Authorization` header.
2.  *Not* sending the `guest_id` in the request body anymore.

The server is successfully validating the token (otherwise, we'd get a 401), but it's still throwing a 403 error, claiming you're trying to book for someone else. This strongly suggests the issue lies in the **backend code** that handles the `/api/guest/booking` route.

It seems the server-side logic is likely still trying to read or compare a `guest_id` from the request body or parameters, even though we removed it from the client request. It should *only* be using the `guestId` extracted from the validated JWT token.

To fix this, we need to look at the server code. I'll start by searching for the definition of the `/api/guest/booking` route to understand how it processes requests and retrieves the guest ID.

Okay, I've found the problem in the backend code.

1.  **`src/server/middleware/validation.js`**: The `validateBooking` middleware explicitly checks if `req.body.guest_id` exists and matches `req.guestId` (the ID from the token). Since we removed `guest_id` from the request body, this check fails and returns the 403 error.
2.  **`src/server/routes/guest.js`**: The `/api/guest/booking` route handler *also* tries to extract `guest_id` from `req.body` and uses it when creating the booking object to save in the database.

We need to make two changes:

1.  Modify `src/server/middleware/validation.js` to remove the check for `req.body.guest_id`. The `authenticateGuest` middleware (which runs before this) already ensures we have a valid `req.guestId` from the token.
2.  Modify `src/server/routes/guest.js` to use `req.guestId` (from the token) instead of `req.body.guest_id` when creating the booking object.

I'll make these changes now.

```diff
  const validateBooking = (req, res, next) => {
    try {
-     const { guest_id, type, service, date, time } = req.body;

        type,
        details: JSON.stringify(bookingDetails),
```

---

_****_

I've made the necessary changes to the backend:

1.  Removed the `guest_id` checks from the `validateBooking` middleware in `src/server/middleware/validation.js`.
2.  Updated the `/api/guest/booking` route handler in `src/server/routes/guest.js` to use `req.guestId` (provided by the authentication middleware from the token) when creating the booking record.

Now, the backend should correctly associate the booking with the authenticated guest based solely on the JWT token. Please try the booking process again. It should work this time!

_**User**_

Good, the booking system works now.

On the staff side, I see the new booking, but it has 'invalid date' for some reason

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, great that the booking creation is working!

The "Invalid date" issue on the staff dashboard suggests a problem with how the date and time are being parsed or formatted in the staff-side JavaScript. The data saved in the database seems correct (it contains separate `date` and `time` fields within the JSON `details`), but the dashboard code might be expecting a different format or failing to combine them properly.

Let's investigate the staff dashboard's JavaScript to see how it handles the booking data. I'll search for the code that fetches and displays bookings for the staff.

You've hit the nail on the head. The issue is in how the staff dashboard's JavaScript (`public/js/staff-dashboard.js`) is trying to display the date and time.

Looking at the code:

1.  The `updateBookingsList` function fetches the bookings. Each booking has a `details` object which correctly contains separate `date` (like "2025-04-08") and `time` (like "08:00") fields.
2.  It then calls the `formatTimestamp` function, but it *only* passes `details.time` (e.g., "08:00").
3.  The `formatTimestamp` function expects a full timestamp string (like "2025-04-08T08:00:00") to create a valid JavaScript `Date` object. When it receives only "08:00", `new Date("08:00")` results in an invalid date, hence the "Invalid date" message.

To fix this, I need to modify the `updateBookingsList` function to combine the `date` and `time` from the `details` object *before* passing it to `formatTimestamp`.

I'll edit `public/js/staff-dashboard.js` now.

I've updated the `updateBookingsList` function in `public/js/staff-dashboard.js`. It now correctly combines the `date` and `time` fields from the booking details into a format like `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:00` before passing it to the `formatTimestamp` function.

This should fix the "Invalid date" display issue on the staff dashboard. Please refresh the staff dashboard page, and the booking time should now appear correctly.

Perfect, that's fixed.

Now the notifications section is only showing messages, when it should also show room service orders and bookings as they come in.

Got it. Currently, the "Notifications" sidebar only gets populated by the `updateChatNotifications` function, which is only called after fetching escalated chats.

To include room service orders and bookings, we need to:

1.  Modify the data fetching process (`fetchRoomServiceOrders`, `fetchBookings`) to make the fetched data available for the notification list.
2.  Create a new function (or modify `updateChatNotifications`) to process and combine *pending* items from chats, orders, and bookings.
3.  Sort these combined notifications by their timestamp.
4.  Render the combined list into the `#notifications-list` element.

Let's start by adjusting the fetching functions (`fetchRoomServiceOrders` and `fetchBookings`) in `public/js/staff-dashboard.js` to return the data instead of directly calling their respective update functions (`updateOrdersList`, `updateBookingsList`). We'll store the data globally for now to combine it later.

Okay, I've set up the structure:

1.  Added global variables (`escalatedChatsData`, `roomServiceOrdersData`, `bookingsData`) to hold the data fetched from the API.
2.  Modified `fetchEscalatedChats`, `fetchRoomServiceOrders`, and `fetchBookings` to store their respective data in these global variables upon successful fetch.
3.  Each fetch function now also calls a new placeholder function `updateCombinedNotifications()`. This function currently just logs the data we have.
4.  The original functions to update the main lists (`updateChatsList`, `updateOrdersList`, `updateBookingsList`) are still called, so the main tabs will continue to work as before.

Now, let's implement the `updateCombinedNotifications` function to process these three data sources (chats, pending orders, pending bookings) and render them into the notification sidebar, sorted by time.

Okay, I've implemented the `updateCombinedNotifications` function in `public/js/staff-dashboard.js`.

Here's what it does:

1.  It takes the globally stored data (`escalatedChatsData`, `roomServiceOrdersData`, `bookingsData`).
2.  It processes each list, extracting *pending* items (all escalated chats are considered pending, along with orders and bookings explicitly marked as 'pending').
3.  It standardizes the data from each source into a common notification format (including `id`, `type`, `guestName`, `roomNumber`, `message`, `timestamp`).
4.  It combines these standardized items into a single list.
5.  It sorts the combined list by timestamp, showing the newest items first.
6.  It renders the sorted list into the `#notifications-list` sidebar, including the correct action buttons for each notification type (Accept/Acknowledge for chats, Confirm for orders, Confirm/Cancel for bookings).
7.  It updates the notification count badge.

I've also commented out the old `updateChatNotifications` function as its logic is now handled by the new combined function.

Now, when chats, orders, or bookings are fetched, the "Notifications" sidebar should update with a combined, sorted list of all pending items. Please refresh the staff dashboard to see the changes.

When you did that, you broke the 'chats' card. It's now endlessly loading data.

You are absolutely right! My apologies, I inadvertently removed the line that updates the main "Chats" tab content.

In the `fetchEscalatedChats` function, I removed the call to `updateChatsList(chats)` when I should have kept it (using the new `escalatedChatsData` variable). This is why the main chat section remains in the loading state.

I also left a call to the now-commented-out `updateChatNotifications` function, which should be removed.

Let's fix `fetchEscalatedChats` in `public/js/staff-dashboard.js` to correctly call `updateChatsList` and remove the call to the deprecated notification function.

```diff
              if (data.status === 'success') {
                  escalatedChatsData = data.data?.chats || []; // Store data
-                 updateChatNotifications(escalatedChatsData); // Keep updating the dedicated chat list for now
+                 updateChatsList(escalatedChatsData); // RE-ADD THIS: Update the main chats list content
                  updateCombinedNotifications(); // Call function to update sidebar
              } else {
```

You are correct, my mistake. I removed the line that updates the main chat list while focusing on the notification sidebar. I also left in a call to the old notification function that should have been removed.

I have now corrected the `fetchEscalatedChats` function in `public/js/staff-dashboard.js`:

1.  **Re-added the call** to `updateChatsList(escalatedChatsData)` to ensure the main "Chats" tab content is updated.
2.  **Removed the call** to the now-deprecated `updateChatNotifications` function.

This should fix the infinite loading issue in the "Chats" tab. Please refresh the staff dashboard again.
